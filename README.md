# WorkoutTracker
 One Day Build for a Workout Tracker

## Specs
Below are the specs I wrote prior to the creation of this program.
- Must be made in one day
- Statically designed around GREYSKULL LP (2.5lbs+ each lift for upper body, 5lbs lower)
- Case statements for each GREYSKULL movement
    - OHP
    - Squats
    - Deadlifts
    - Bench
    - Chinups
    - Rows
- Outputs maxes for the day in a .csv file for stat tracking
- Will contain a driver program to take user inputs for lifts and weights.
- Main method will print out these values into a .csv file.
    - This must not overwrite the file. It will make the columns once and add to the file each time the program is ran.

## Build time
This ended up taking me 1.5 hrs to build. 

## Next Build Idea
The next one day build I plan on doing is a program to track progress via the .csv file I have written.
- This program will read the .csv file and determine if I am on track by GREYSKULL LP standards
   - is my progress linear (2.5 pounds for upper body, 5 pounds for lower body)
   - is it better? If so, encourage user
   - is it worse? If so, remind user to eat and sleep properly
