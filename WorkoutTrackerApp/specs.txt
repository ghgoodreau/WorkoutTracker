WORKOUT TRACKER APP
3/27/2020
One day build

- Statically designed around GREYSKULL LP (2.5lbs+ each lift for upper body, 5lbs lower)
- Case statements for each GREYSKULL movement
    this includes
      - OHP
      - Bench
      - Deadlift
      - Rows
      - Squats
      - Chinups
- outputs maxes for the day in a csv file for stat tracking
- Will contain a driver program to take user inputs for lifts and weights.
- Main method will print out these values into a CSV. (this will not overwrite the file. It will make the columns once and add to the file each time the program is ran.)
